    "## Gemboard: Visualize Ideas, Unlock Insights - An Infinite Canvas for Brainstorming and Data Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gemboard** is a powerful Flutter application designed for brainstorming and data mining using an infinite canvas. It combines visual representations with the power of large language models, specifically Google's Gemini with its impressive **2 million token context window**, enabling in-depth exploration of complex ideas and dynamic information analysis.  This extensive context allows Gemini to consider a vast amount of information when generating suggestions and assisting with content creation within Gemboard.\n",
